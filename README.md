# Voice Cloning and Lip Syncing with Tortoise TTS and Wav2Lip


![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Voice+Cloning+%26+Lip+Syncing+Pipeline)  
*Seamless integration of voice cloning and lip synchronization technologies*

## Project Overview
This project integrates voice cloning using [Tortoise TTS](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts) and lip-syncing using [Wav2Lip](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip) into a single Gradio interface. The user can input a reference audio and text to clone a voice, and optionally sync the generated audio to a video.

## Features

- Voice cloning using Tortoise TTS with reference audio and input text
- Lip-syncing the cloned voice to a face video using Wav2Lip
- Minimal Gradio-based interface for user interaction
- Example assets provided for quick testing

## Run on Kaggle

You can try this project directly on Kaggle without any local setup:

**[Open in Kaggle →][(https://www.kaggle.com/code/parihasakreddy/voiceclone-lipsync-ipynb)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/parihasakreddy/voiceclone-lipsync-ipynb))**
use public URL generated by Gradio similar to this (https://ede71ceff821057658.gradio.live)

**Notes:**
- Initial loading may take approximately 3 minutes.
- Use the files in the `assets/` directory to test the pipeline.
- Voice cloning typically takes 2–3 minutes for short text.
- Lip-syncing may not yield good results for very short voice samples. For best results, test lip-syncing with longer audio.
- Alternatively, lip-syncing can be tested independently using this notebook:
